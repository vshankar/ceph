# Enable mgr modules now before any CephFS mounts are created by the mgr.  This
# avoids the potential race of the mgr mounting CephFS and then getting failed
# over by the monitors before the monitors have a chance to note the new client
# session from the mgr beacon. In that case, the monitors will not blocklist
# that client mount automatically so the MDS will eventually do the eviction
# (and create a cluster log warning which we want to avoid).
#
# Note: ideally the mgr would gently stop mgr modules before respawning so that
# the client mounts can be unmounted but this caused issues historically with
# modules like the dashboard so an abrupt restart was chosen instead.
